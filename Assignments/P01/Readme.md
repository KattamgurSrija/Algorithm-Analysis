This project explores the impact of insertion and deletion operations on Binary Search Trees (BSTs), focusing on how different deletion strategies affect tree balance over time. Specifically, it compares Asymmetric Deletion (where deleted nodes are replaced by their successors) and Symmetric Deletion (where deletion alternates between successor and predecessor).

The key metric analyzed is the Internal Path Length (IPL), which represents the sum of all node depths in the BST. By performing multiple Insertion/Deletion (I/D) cycles, the project tracks IPL trends to determine whether certain deletion methods lead to a more or less balanced tree.

The study is based on the research paper "An Empirical Study of Insertion and Deletion in Binary Search Trees" by Jeffrey L. Eppinger, aiming to validate its findings through practical experimentation. The results are visualized using IPL trend graphs, comparing how different deletion strategies affect BST efficiency.
